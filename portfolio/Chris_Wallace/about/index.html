						<h1>Meet Chris</h1>
						<img src="../images/meet_chris.jpg"/>
						<p>My name is Chris Wallace, and I am running for the Ohio House of Representatives in the 74th District. This district is my home - I was raised in Plain City, where the values of hard work and giving back to the community were instilled in me from an early age by my parents and grandparents. Conservative values were instilled in me from an early age, and I want to work on behalf of you to advocate those values in Columbus.</p>
							<p>I graduated from Jonathan Alder High School and was lucky enough to earn an undergraduate degree from The Ohio State University. My desire to serve brought me back home after graduating from law school at Indiana University and I am currently a practicing attorney. I am an active member in our community and still attend church at St. Joseph’s Parish in Plain City on Sundays.</p>
							<p>If elected, I’m going to work hard every day to fight for the issues we feel strongly about as conservatives – smaller government, the sanctity of life, Second Amendment rights, and the small-town values that make our community a great place to live and raise a family.</p>
							<p>I look forward to meeting you on the campaign trail and would be grateful for your support in the March 15th primary election.</p>
